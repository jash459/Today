### E-commerce System Design

#### 1. **Problem Statement**
Design an e-commerce system that manages products, orders, customers, and payments while addressing scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time updates.

---

#### 2. **System Requirements and Solutions**

1. **Product Management**
   - *Solution*: The system should support the addition, updating, and removal of products, and track inventory for each product.

2. **Customer Management**
   - *Solution*: Customers should be able to create accounts, view their order history, and maintain personal details (e.g., shipping address, payment methods).

3. **Order Management**
   - *Solution*: The system should process customer orders, track order status, and handle returns and cancellations.

4. **Shopping Cart Management**
   - *Solution*: Customers should be able to add, remove, or update products in their shopping cart.

5. **Payment and Checkout**
   - *Solution*: The system should integrate with various payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, credit card processing) and securely process transactions.

6. **Inventory Management**
   - *Solution*: Track product stock levels and notify customers or admins when items are out of stock or running low.

7. **Discounts and Promotions**
   - *Solution*: Allow for flexible pricing mechanisms like discounts, promotions, and coupon codes.

8. **Product Search and Filtering**
   - *Solution*: Implement efficient search and filtering by product categories, price, rating, and availability.

9. **Recommendation Engine**
   - *Solution*: Provide personalized recommendations to customers based on their browsing history and past orders.

10. **Scalability**
    - *Solution*: The system should handle large traffic spikes during events like sales or holidays by using load balancing, caching, and database replication.

#### 3. **Key Classes, Functions, and Relationships**

1. **Class: `Product`**
   - Represents a product with attributes like name, category, price, inventory, and discount information.

2. **Class: `Customer`**
   - Stores customer details, including name, email, address, and order history.

3. **Class: `ShoppingCart`**
   - Manages the current shopping session for a customer, including the list of products to be purchased.

4. **Class: `Order`**
   - Represents an order placed by a customer, including products, payment status, and delivery details.

5. **Class: `Payment`**
   - Handles payment processing and integration with payment gateways.

6. **Class: `Inventory`**
   - Manages stock levels of products, ensuring accurate data on available quantities.

---

#### 4. **Data Structures Used**

- **Hash Map** (used in `Product` for product categories and inventory):  
   - For fast lookup of products by category, price, or other attributes.
   - **Complexity**: O(1) for lookups and updates.

- **Vector** (used in `ShoppingCart` for storing product details):  
   - Efficient for dynamic manipulation of products in the cart.
   - **Complexity**: O(n) for traversing and managing the cart.

---

#### 5. **High-Level Design**

- **Product**: Manages product details like category, price, stock, and promotions.
- **Customer**: Stores customer-related information, including account details and order history.
- **ShoppingCart**: Maintains the current list of items a customer wishes to purchase.
- **Order**: Records order information, including purchased products and delivery status.
- **Payment**: Coordinates with payment gateways to handle transactions.
- **Inventory**: Tracks stock levels for each product, ensuring customers canâ€™t buy out-of-stock items.

---

#### 6. **Clarifications to Ask the Interviewer (with Solutions)**

1. **What happens when an item is out of stock during checkout?**
   - *Solution*: Determine whether the item should be placed on backorder or removed from the order.

2. **Should the system support guest checkouts (without registration)?**
   - *Solution*: Decide if customers can make purchases without creating an account.

3. **How are returns and refunds handled?**
   - *Solution*: Clarify the refund policy and process for returned products.

---

#### 7. **Open-Ended Questions from the Interviewer**

1. **How would you ensure that product recommendations are accurate and personalized?**
   - *Solution*: Use machine learning algorithms to suggest products based on past customer behavior, similar products, and collaborative filtering.

2. **How would you handle flash sales or large spikes in user traffic?**
   - *Solution*: Use caching (e.g., Redis), load balancers, and horizontal scaling for handling large volumes of traffic.

#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

### Explanation of Code

- **Product Class**: Represents product details including price, discount, and stock.
- **Customer Class**: Holds customer information and order history.
- **ShoppingCart Class**: Manages items in the cart and calculates total amounts.
- **Order Class**: Manages customer orders, tracks order

This C++ e-commerce system design allows for product management, customer registration, order processing, shopping cart functionality, payment handling, and inventory management. It uses key classes such as `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Payment` to implement essential e-commerce operations. The system supports operations like adding products to a cart, calculating total costs, processing payments, updating inventory, and storing customer order history.

To handle scalability, this design can incorporate microservices, load balancing, and caching for large-scale e-commerce operations.
