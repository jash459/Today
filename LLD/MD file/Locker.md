Sure! Letâ€™s structure the **Amazon Locker System** code and explanation similarly to the **Amazon Transportation System** you provided. This will cover all aspects of the locker system while ensuring clarity, organization, and an understanding of the relationships between classes.

### 1. **Problem Statement: Designing Amazon Locker System**

The Amazon Locker system allows users to store and retrieve packages securely. It manages locker assignments, ensures efficient package retrieval, and handles different package sizes, allowing for scalability and maintainability.

---

### 2. **System Requirements and Solutions**

1. **Locker Management**  
   - *Solution*: The `Locker` class represents a locker that can store packages. It has properties like size and availability.

2. **Package Handling**  
   - *Solution*: The `Package` class defines the attributes of packages, including size and ID, enabling efficient storage and retrieval.

3. **Package Assignment**  
   - *Solution*: The `PickupLocation` class manages lockers and handles the assignment of packages to available lockers based on size.

4. **Package Retrieval**  
   - *Solution*: Packages can be retrieved from their assigned lockers, ensuring users can access their items easily.

5. **Traffic Management**  
   - *Solution*: The system prioritizes larger packages for lockers during peak times, ensuring better space utilization.

---

### 3. **Key Classes, Functions, and Relationships**

1. **Class: `Package`**  
   - Represents a package with size and ID attributes. Provides methods to access its size and ID.

2. **Class: `Locker`**  
   - Represents a locker with a size and manages the storage of a package.

3. **Class: `PickupLocation`**  
   - Manages multiple lockers and their availability. Assigns packages to lockers based on their size and retrieves them.

---

### 4. **Data Structures Used**

- **Map** (in `PickupLocation`):  
   - Used to map package IDs to their respective lockers, enabling quick access to retrieve packages.
   - **Complexity**: O(1) for lookups and inserts.

- **Queue** (for available lockers):  
   - Used to efficiently manage available lockers of different sizes.
   - **Complexity**: O(1) for insertions and O(n) for lookups based on queue size.

---

### 5. **High-Level Design**

- **Package**: Represents the package with attributes like size and ID.
- **Locker**: Manages the storage and retrieval of packages.
- **PickupLocation**: Oversees the assignment of packages to lockers and handles retrieval processes.

---

### 6. **Clarifications to Ask the Interviewer (with Solutions)**

1. **What types of packages will be stored?**  
   - *Solution*: If there are multiple package sizes (e.g., small, medium, large), the system should support them effectively by prioritizing their placement.

2. **Should the system support user notifications?**  
   - *Solution*: If required, notifications can be added for users when their package is ready for pickup.

3. **Are there limits on locker usage?**  
   - *Solution*: If there are limits, the system should handle locker capacity and manage overflow scenarios efficiently.

---

### 7. **Open-Ended Questions from the Interviewer**

1. **How would you scale the system for thousands of lockers?**  
   - *Solution*: Implement a distributed system for managing lockers across multiple locations, utilizing microservices for scalability.

2. **How would you manage expired packages in lockers?**  
   - *Solution*: Introduce a timestamp for each package, and periodically check for expired packages for automatic retrieval or notification.

### 8. **C++ Code Implementation**

```cpp

    Size getSize() const {
        return size; // Return package size
    }

    string getId() const {
        return id; // Return package ID
    }

### Explanation of Code
- **`Package`**: Represents a package with size and ID. It provides methods to retrieve these attributes.
- **`Locker`**: Represents a locker that can store a package. It manages the package's storage and retrieval, and maintains its size and ID.
- **`PickupLocation`**: Manages multiple lockers. It assigns packages to available lockers based on size and retrieves them when needed.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamically allocated lockers are cleaned up in the destructor of `PickupLocation`.

This design provides a clear, scalable, and maintainable locker system for Amazon, with the potential for future enhancements such as handling more complex package management or notifications.
