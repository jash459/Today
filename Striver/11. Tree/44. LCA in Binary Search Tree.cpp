/*
Approach: 
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) involves traversing the tree from the root while comparing the values of the two nodes with the current node. At each step, if both nodes are smaller, move left; if larger, move right. When they diverge (one left, one right, or one is the current node), that node is the LCA.

This approach leverages the BSTâ€™s structure, efficiently narrowing down the search space based on node values.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start at the root of the Binary Search Tree.

Step 2: Compare the values of the two nodes with the value of the current node.

If both nodes are smaller than the current node, they are both to its left hence move to its left child.
If both nodes are larger than the current node, they are both to its right hence move to its right child.
If one node is to the left and the other to the right of the current node, or if one node is the current node itself, then the current node is the LCA.
Step 3: Traverse down the tree based on the comparison of the node values, narrow done the search space by eliminating subtrees where the LCA cannot exist.


Step 4: Stop the recursion when both nodes are found in different subtrees of the current node or one of the nodes become the current node itself. Return the current node.
