1. Brute :


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool searchInARotatedSortedArrayII(vector<int>&arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size(); // size of the array.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == k) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int k = 3;
    bool ans = searchInARotatedSortedArrayII(arr, k);
    if (!ans)
        cout << "Target is not present.\n";
    else
        cout << "Target is present in the array.\n";
    return 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(N), N = size of the given array.
Reason: We have to iterate through the entire array to check if the target is present in the array.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Reason: We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).

// 2. Optimal : 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool searchInARotatedSortedArrayII(vector<int>&arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size(); // size of the array.
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        //if mid points the target
        if (arr[mid] == k) return true;

        //Edge case:
        if (arr[low] == arr[mid] && arr[mid] == arr[high]) {
            low = low + 1;
            high = high - 1;
            continue;
        }

        //if left part is sorted:
        if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
            if (arr[low] <= k && k <= arr[mid]) {
                //element exists:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                //element does not exist:
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        else { //if right part is sorted:
            if (arr[mid] <= k && k <= arr[high]) {
                //element exists:
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                //element does not exist:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int k = 3;
    bool ans = searchInARotatedSortedArrayII(arr, k);
    if (!ans)
        cout << "Target is not present.\n";
    else
        cout << "Target is present in the array.\n";
    return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: O(logN) for the best and average case. O(N/2) for the worst case. Here, N = size of the given array.
// Reason: In the best and average scenarios, the binary search algorithm is primarily utilized and hence the time complexity is O(logN). However, in the worst-case scenario, where all array elements are the same but not the target (e.g., given array = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}), we continue to reduce the search space by adjusting the low and high pointers until they intersect. This worst-case situation incurs a time complexity of O(N/2).

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Reason: We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
