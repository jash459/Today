/*
1. Brute
Approach :

Step 1: Find all possible permutations of elements present and store them.

Step 2: Search input from all possible permutations.

Step 3: Print the next permutation present right after it.

For reference of how to find all possible permutations, follow up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ic2Rsc9pU&t=32s. This video shows for distinct elements but code works for duplicates too.

For finding, all possible permutations, it is taking N!xN. N represents the number of elements present in the input array. Also for searching input arrays from all possible permutations will take N!. Therefore, it has a Time complexity of O(N!xN).

Space Complexity :

Since we are not using any extra spaces except stack spaces for recursion calls. So, it has a space complexity of O(1).*/

2. Better

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1,3,2};
    
    next_permutation(arr,arr+3);//using in-built function of C++
    
    cout<<arr[0]<<" "<<arr[1]<<" "<<arr[2];
    
    return 0;
}
*/

// 3. Optimal 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> nextGreaterPermutation(vector<int> &A) {
    int n = A.size(); // size of the array.

    // Step 1: Find the break point:
    int ind = -1; // break point
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (A[i] < A[i + 1]) {
            // index i is the break point
            ind = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // If break point does not exist:
    if (ind == -1) {
        // reverse the whole array:
        reverse(A.begin(), A.end());
        return A;
    }

    // Step 2: Find the next greater element
    //         and swap it with arr[ind]:

    for (int i = n - 1; i > ind; i--) {
        if (A[i] > A[ind]) {
            swap(A[i], A[ind]);
            break;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: reverse the right half:
    reverse(A.begin() + ind + 1, A.end());

    return A;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> A = {2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0, 0};
    vector<int> ans = nextGreaterPermutation(A);

    cout << "The next permutation is: [";
    for (auto it : ans) {
        cout << it << " ";
    }
    cout << "]n";
    return 0;
}
// Time Complexity: O(3N), where N = size of the given array
// Finding the break-point, finding the next greater element, and reversal at the end takes O(N) for each, where N is the number of elements in the input array. This sums up to 3*O(N) which is approximately O(3N).

// Space Complexity: Since no extra storage is required. Thus, its space complexity is O(1).
