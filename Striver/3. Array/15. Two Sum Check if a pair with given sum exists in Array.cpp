Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.
Reason: There are two loops(i.e. nested) each running for approximately N times.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

// Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of the array.
// Reason: The loop runs N times in the worst case and searching in a hashmap takes O(1) generally. So the time complexity is O(N).

// Note: In the worst case(which rarely happens), the unordered_map takes O(N) to find an element. In that case, the time complexity will be O(N2). If we use map instead of unordered_map, the time complexity will be O(N* logN) as the map data structure takes logN time to find an element.

// Space Complexity: O(N) as we use the map data structure.

// Note: We have optimized this problem enough. But if in the interview, we are not allowed to use the map data structure, then we should move on to the following approach i.e. two pointer approach. This approach will have the same time complexity as the better approach.

// 3. Optimal 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

}
// Output: This is the answer for variant 1: YES

// Note: For variant 2, we can store the elements of the array along with its index in a new array. Then the rest of the code will be similar. And while returning, we need to return the stored indices instead of returning “YES”. But for this variant, the recommended approach is approach 2 i.e. hashing approach.

// Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
// Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.

// Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

// Note: Here we are distorting the given array. So, if we need to consider this change, the space complexity will be O(N).
