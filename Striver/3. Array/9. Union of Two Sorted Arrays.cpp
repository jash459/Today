/*
1. Brute : Using Map

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  map < int, int > freq;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[arr1[i]]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    freq[arr2[i]]++;
  for (auto & it: freq)
    Union.push_back(it.first);
  return Union;
}

int main() {
  int n = 10, m = 7;
  int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int arr2[] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12};
  vector < int > Union = FindUnion(arr1, arr2, n, m);
  cout << "Union of arr1 and arr2 is " << endl;
  for (auto & val: Union)
    cout << val << " ";
  return 0;
}

Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) ) . Inserting a key in map takes logN times, where N is no of elements in map. At max map can store m+n elements {when there are no common elements and elements in arr,arr2 are distntict}. So Inserting m+n th element takes log(m+n) time. Upon approximation across insertion of all elements in worst it would take O((m+n)log(m+n) time.

Using HashMap also takes the same time, On average insertion in unordered_map takes O(1) time but sorting the union vector takes O((m+n)log(m+n))  time. Because at max union vector can have m+n elements.

Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union ArrayList is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union ArrayList is not considered}*/

/*
2. Better : Using Set

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  set < int > s;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    s.insert(arr1[i]);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    s.insert(arr2[i]);
  for (auto & it: s)
    Union.push_back(it);
  return Union;
}

int main()

{
  int n = 10, m = 7;
  int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int arr2[] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12};
  vector < int > Union = FindUnion(arr1, arr2, n, m);
  cout << "Union of arr1 and arr2 is  " << endl;
  for (auto & val: Union)
    cout << val << " ";
  return 0;
}

Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) ) . Inserting an element in a set takes logN time, where N is no of elements in the set. At max set can store m+n elements {when there are no common elements and elements in arr,arr2 are distntict}. So Inserting m+n th element takes log(m+n) time. Upon approximation across inserting all elements in worst, it would take O((m+n)log(m+n) time.

Using HashSet also takes the same time, On average insertion in unordered_set takes O(1) time but sorting the union vector takes O((m+n)log(m+n))  time. Because at max union vector can have m+n elements.

Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union ArrayList is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union ArrayList is not considered}*/\

// 3. Optimal : Two Pointers



#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  int i = 0, j = 0; // pointers
  vector < int > Union; // Uninon vector
  while (i < n && j < m) {
    if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) // Case 1 and 2
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i])
        Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
      i++;
    } else // case 3
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr2[j])
        Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  while (i < n) // IF any element left in arr1
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr1[i])
      Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
    i++;
  }
  while (j < m) // If any elements left in arr2
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr2[j])
      Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
    j++;
  }
  return Union;
}

int main()

{
  int n = 10, m = 7;
  int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int arr2[] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12}; 
  vector < int > Union = FindUnion(arr1, arr2, n, m);
  cout << "Union of arr1 and arr2 is  " << endl;
  for (auto & val: Union)
    cout << val << " ";
  return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: O(m+n), Because at max i runs for n times and j runs for m times. When there are no common elements in arr1 and arr2 and all elements in arr1, arr2 are distinct. 
// Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union ArrayList is considered} 
// O(1) {If Space of union ArrayList is not considered}
